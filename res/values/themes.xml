         The default definition is the safe one, using a theme that has always
         been defined.  Look at values-11/styles.xml for a variation that is
         selected when the holographic theme is available. -->

         our own wrapper theme that uses it only when running on the appropriate
         platform version.  On older platforms, we always use the generic
         fullscreen theme, because they don't support some feature that help
         in correctly laying out an activity as a dialog. -->
